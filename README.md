# ShadeWatcher

This is a **_complete_** version of the Shadewatcher system with a reimplementation of the original system (interaction extraction) by the help of the authors of the paper. This code automatically creates training files for the recommendation model as an output of the parser.

Note: This reimplementation was tested on Ubuntu 18.0.4 currently. For setup using Ubuntu 18.0.4 refer to the attached Vagrantfile in this repository and the attached documentation.
